Good way of me to learn ruby 

Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It was created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in the mid-1990s and is designed to be easy to read and write while maintaining powerful features.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of Ruby:
Object-Oriented â€“ Everything in Ruby is an object, including primitive data types.
Dynamic & Interpreted â€“ No need for compilation; it runs directly in an interpreter.
Easy to Read & Write â€“ Uses a clean and elegant syntax, often compared to natural language.
Metaprogramming â€“ Ruby allows modifying classes and methods at runtime.
Garbage Collection â€“ Handles memory management automatically.
Duck Typing â€“ Type checking is done at runtime based on behavior rather than explicit type declarations.
Rich Standard Library â€“ Comes with a strong set of built-in modules and classes.
Community & Gems â€“ Extensive libraries (gems) make development faster and easier.

Common Uses:
Web Development â†’ With frameworks like Ruby on Rails (Rails), it's a popular choice for startups and scalable web applications.
Automation & Scripting â†’ Used for DevOps, automation scripts, and system administration.
Data Processing â†’ Employed in various data-driven applications.
Game Development â†’ Though not mainstream, Ruby has libraries like Gosu for 2D game development.
